Between 2015-2017 and as an independent researcher he studied the evolution of glaciers and the climate on Mount Olympus in Greece, during a project funded by John S. Latsis foundation in cooperation with researchers from the French National research institute CEREGE (Centre de Recherche et d’Enseignement de Géosciences de l’Environnement).</p>
<p>In addition to his academic activities, since 2004 he has been managing the alpine refuge Christos Kakkalos on Mount Olympus and has climbed extensively on the mountains of Greece, as well as on the peaks of the Alps, Norway, Russia and North America. He has participated in 10 expeditions in the Andes and the Himalaya and was a member of the first successful Greek expedition that stood on the summit of Mount Everest.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center primary">Bio</h3><p>Romy Lorenz is a cognitive neuroscientist with a multidisciplinary background in psychology and biomedical engineering.
Currently, she is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Lab (<a href="https://www.c3nl.com/">C3NL</a>) at Imperial College London. In September this year, she will take up her 4-year long Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship to work with <a href="http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?johnduncan">John Duncan</a> at Cambridge University (UK) and <a href="https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/">Russ Poldrack</a> at Stanford University (US).
Her research interest lies in developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and artificial intelligence (AI) using different neuroimaging techniques and by applying machine learning. Rather than looking at BCIs through the lens of assistive technology though, she is passionate about using BCIs as a new experimental paradigm in cognitive neuroscience.
She received her PhD from Imperial College London in June 2017, under the supervision of <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/robert.leech.html">Robert Leech</a>. For her PhD, she has developed an &quot;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/automatic-neuroscientist-ai-brain-experiments">AI neuroscientist</a>&quot; – a novel BCI for optimizing experimental design by combining real-time fMRI with Bayesian optimization.
Alongside her research, she is working as a co-director for <a href="https://axnscollective.org/">AXNS</a>, a curatorial collective interested in the intersection between neuroscience and art.</p>
